When downloading files using Safari browser in iPad, the files will be saved on your iCloud drive.
For me, I want to download the files locally without filling up my iCloud space.

The download location can be changed easily. Open `Settings -> Safari`. In the `GENERAL` section,
click `Downloads` settings. Change `STORE DOWNLOADED FILES ON` option to `On My iPad`.

After that, all the downloaded files will be saved locally instead of on iCloud.
