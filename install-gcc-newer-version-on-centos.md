The default GCC that comes with the CentOS 7.2 is GCC 4.8.5, which does not
support the complete C++11 standard, for example, it does not fully support
[regular expressions](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/regex). In order to use
regular expression functions, [we need to install at least GCC
4.9.0](https://stackoverflow.com/a/8061172/6064933). The following installation
procedure is applicable to CentOS 7 and are not tested on other Linux systems.
Also you have to make sure that you have root privelege.  <!--more-->

Update:

[GCC 8.3 has been released on Feb 22,
2019](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/8.3.0/).  The installation process is the
same as prvevious versions. Download the corrent tar file from the GNU ftp
server, compile and install it.

# Downloading GCC source code

You can download the GCC source code from the [official GNU
ftp](https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/). I choose to install [version
5.4.0](https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/gcc-5.4.0/).

```
curl https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/gcc-5.4.0/gcc-5.4.0.tar.bz2 -O
tar jxvf gcc-5.4.0.tar.bz2
```

# Install dependencies

We need to install 3 dependencies packages. It is [recommended to install these
packages through yum](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/InstallingGCC). 

```
yum install gmp-devel mpfr-devel libmpc-devel
```

# Configuration and install

Unlike other packages, it is recommended to create another build directory
outside of the GCC source directory to build GCC. 

```
mkdir gcc-5.4.0-build
cd gcc-5.4.0-build
../gcc-5.4.0/configure --enable-languages=c,c++ --disable-multilib
make -j$(nproc) && make install
```

The comiplation process may take a long time and you need to be patient. It
will install GCC under `/usr/local`. You can change the install dir using
`--prefix` option if you prefer.

# Post-installation

You should add the install dir of GCC to your `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` in
order to use the newer GCC. Add the following settings to `/etc/profile`:

```
export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

Maybe a restart of your current session is also needed.

You can download the whole install script
